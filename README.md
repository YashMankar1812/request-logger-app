# Implementing Request Logging Middleware in Node.js with Express

## Description
This assignment involves creating a Node.js application using Express to implement a middleware function for logging incoming requests. The middleware will capture essential details such as the request method, URL, IP address, and timestamps to gain insights into application traffic.

## Objective
The main goal is to:
- Understand middleware's role in the request processing pipeline.
- Implement custom middleware for request logging.
- Optionally utilize advanced logging libraries like Morgan for enhanced logging capabilities.

---

## Key Learning Objectives
1. Understand how middleware processes requests in Express.
2. Implement custom middleware functions for request logging.
3. Use libraries like Morgan for advanced logging capabilities.
4. Explore logging levels (e.g., info, debug) for controlling log verbosity.

---
## Testing and Documentation

### Testing
1. Use tools like `Postman` or `curl` to send requests to the application.
2. Observe the console output for logged details about each request.

### Documentation
- `requestLogger`: Logs request method, URL, IP address, and timestamp.
- `Morgan`: An optional library for enhanced logging capabilities.
- Challenges: Explain any difficulties encountered during implementation and how they were resolved.
